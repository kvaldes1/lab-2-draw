# Lab 2 - Draw!

*Use P5 basic shape functions to draw a picture*

In the first Lab, you created a new P5.js sketch. Credit for that lab is awarded for successfully linking a web page (```index.html```) to the P5.js code library and adding some JavaScript code to a connected script file (```script.js```), and making a "commit" on GitHub. For some of you, that might have been a leap of faith already.

Now it's time to actually write some original code that will generate your own graphics in a browser window! You should carefully read **Chapter 3 - Draw** in McCarthy, et al: *Make: Getting Started with P5.js.* Consider using this lab as a place to try out some of the examples in chapter 3.

- Edit the file "```script.js```" to create something original.
- NOTE: In your script, there should be **only one** instance of ```setup()``` and only one instance of ```draw()```!

### This lab is worth **10 points**, allocated according to the following criteria/rubric:

- 1 - 4 points: Generate at least **four different shapes**, using **at least three** of the following basic shape functions:
  - ```point()```
  - ```line()```
  - ```rect()```
  - ```ellipse()```
  - ```triangle()```
- 1 - 3 points: Apply color, line weighting, and advanced shape techniques with **at least three** of the following:
  - ```fill()```
  - ```stroke()```
  - ```strokeWeight()```
  - ```arc()```
  - ```vertex()``` (with appropriate use of ```beginShape()``` and ```endShape()``` )
  - a ```for()``` loop to draw a repetitive pattern
- 1 - 2 points: **Creativity**
  - full points if the image that appears on the canvas is a coherent composite image made up of multiple basic shapes
  - 1 point if the image is disjointed or incoherent, or is mostly derivative of one of the textbook examples
- 1 point: **Submitted** complete and in the correct format
  - Commit on GtiHub as "Lab 2 - Draw Submitted"
  - Uploaded to Sakai as .zip archive (from GitHub, look at code tab, choose "download" to save a .zip archive of your work)
  - Paste a link to the project repository in the Sakai submission comments box (copy from the address bar in your browser)
